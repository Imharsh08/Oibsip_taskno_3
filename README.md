# **EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING**
The "Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning" GitHub repository, created by Harsh Kashyap, is a comprehensive project that focuses on developing a machine learning-based solution for detecting and classifying email spam. 

The repository contains a collection of Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and data files that are used to train and evaluate various machine learning models for spam detection. Harsh Kashyap has implemented different algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, to build and compare the performance of these models.

The project includes a detailed README file that provides an overview of the repository, instructions for setting up the environment, and guidelines for running the code. It also includes a description of the dataset used for training and testing the models.

Harsh Kashyap has demonstrated a strong understanding of machine learning concepts and techniques through this repository. The code is well-organized, documented, and follows best practices in machine learning development. The repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in email spam detection and machine learning, providing a foundation for further research and development in this field.
